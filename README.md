# Tt Games - quickbms scripts

## Disclaimer
This repository was made just with the intention of preserve the script versions I use while modding games made by Tt games. This might either be used to extract the content inside the DAT files of the game or for a different purpose.

All credit goes to quickbms creators cause I didn't make any of these scripts or the quickbms tool.

## How to download the files of this repository
Just simply click the green box with the word that says "Code" and then it will open a small window. On that window, select the option "Download ZIP". It will download all the files in your PC. When the process is done, go to where the ZIP file was downloaded and extract its content there. After that you are free to use the tool ðŸ˜‰.

## Errors reported:
### 1.- Why the tool isn't working after double clicking it?
In case that happened, then do the following:

1.- In the tab above, go to File -> Open Windows Powershell.

2.- Put the name of the file you wanna open with its extension.

3.- Follow the steps to be able to extract dat files.

### 2.- Why the tool doesn't extract the files contained inside the DAT files?
It might be due to these reasons:

1.- The bms script you selected is not the correct one.

2.- The DAT file is not a valid one (E.g. Transformers The Game for Xbox 360).

3.- The DAT files are corrupted (careful with extracting DAT files from PS3 or Xbox 360 ISOs).

4.- The DAT file is too big to be processed on the memory, showing memory allocation problem on quickbms (happens with the DAT file from TCS PS3).
