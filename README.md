# Tt Games - quickbms scripts
This repository was made just with the intention of preserve the script versions I use while modding games made by Tt games. This might either be used to extract the content inside the DAT files of the game or for a different purpose.

All credit goes to quickbms creators cause I didn't make any of these scripts or the quickbms tool.

If I had to update anything from this repository, let me know here or on discord: linterni-gamer#0019
