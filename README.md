# Tt Games - quickbms scripts
This repository was made just with the intention of preserve the script versions I use while modding the game. This might either be used to extract the content inside the DAT files of the game or for a different purpose.

All credit goes to quickbms creators cause I didn't make none of these scripts or the quickbms tool.
